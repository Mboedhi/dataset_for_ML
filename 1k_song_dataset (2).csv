But it's not enough to know you're mine
The signs
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine

Over
And over again now
Reliving all my fears
Wondering why I'm here
Laying in your bed sheets
With nothing else between
But a bunch of question marks
Promises in the dark
We focus
You and me
I tell my friends 'bout what we could be
But the signs you've given aren't clear
It gets a little crazy around here
Cause I

I don't want to be the one who says it first
And I don't want to be out here looking so thirsty
And now all I'm sure of this thing fucking hurts
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine
The signs

You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine

You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine

Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why
This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried
I can't unlove you
My heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
But feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
I can't unlove you
Come love me for now
If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
'Til I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few
But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
And this is going nowhere
If I'm with you, I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight
They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
Well, the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasn't lost until you found me
And I can't unlove you
My heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt

Midnight drives and summer skin

To shadows in my apartment

Purple skies and cigarettes

To be staring into headlights
Pretending that it's alright

Feel like I was worth the love
We used to hold hands, now I dance alone
We had Springsteen playing so loud
We danced in the dark 'til it felt like home
With you, home was anywhere
But you will never be left behind
Give me a moment, I need just a little more time
If I could, I would have made things right
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
Never apart you're still running through my blood
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
We can't go back to the way that we used to
Be talking through the night, you laying by my side
You were always there to heal my scars
And into the dawn I do my best to try and find some sleep
But you still keep me up
We used to hold hands, now I dance alone
We had Springsteen playing so loud
We danced in the dark 'til it felt like home
With you, home was anywhere
But you will never be left behind
Give me a moment, I need just a little more time
If I could, I would have made things right
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
Never apart you're still running through my blood
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
But we can't go back to the way that we used to
But I can't escape, you're still in my head
I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness
But I can't escape, you're still in my head
I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness
But I can't escape, you're still in my head

Leaving behind the reality
Become the cool of formalities

'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

Well, it's eating me up inside

Now if we jump together, at least we can swing
Far away from the wreck we made

'Til we are broken, 'til we are broken

… But I've been told
That it will get better when it rains
The flowers, they won't grow
With only the good and sunny days

… 'Cause it's only when it rains that we grow
But it's only when it rains that we grow
But it's only when it rains we grow
But it's only when it rains that we grow
But it's only when it–

… Don't know when, don't know where it started from
But I always knew that I'd be on the run
My feet gets weak whenever I'm missing home
Looks like it's fading, whatever I'm chasing

… 'Cause I've been told
That it will get better when it rains
The flowers, they will grow
With only the good and sunny days

… 'Cause it's only when it rains that we grow
It's only when it rains that we grow
It's only when it rains we grow
It's only when it rains that we grow
'Cause it's only when it rains that we grow
But it's only when it rains that we grow
But it's only when it rains we grow
But it's only when it rains that we grow

… 'Cause I've been told
That it will get better when it rains
The flowers, they will grow
With only the good and sunny days
'Cause it's only when it rains"

Spendin' summer in a ghost town

Singing Champagne Supernova

Stole your daddy's Jaguar
Didn't know where we belong

To be crying in the sun
The ocean couldn't take us away, take us away
Didn't need nobody else
I wanted you to crash into me, crash into me
Remember how it felt
When the night turned into day
Always on the run
Moonshine and some nicotine
And we were way too young
To be crying in the sun
To be crying in the sun
Where did those days go
High on your love by the beach
You were my drug, oh
We would make out in the streets
And you drove me in a shopping cart
Felt like we were a piece of art

You never hold me back in anything
You didn't even have to try
I made up my mind
And I know, I know you'll be there
With just one touch
You take me there
Without your love
We go nowhere
With just one touch (you're always there to remind me)
You take me there (when water's rough you will still be there)
Without your love (you're always there right beside me)
We go nowhere
With just one touch
With just one touch
Hold me tight, I'll never let you leave
Let me go, I'll live in disbelief
You say the truth, every time you speak
Without a doubt, got everything I need, yeah
Hold me tight, I'll never let you leave
Let me go, I'll live in disbelief
You say the truth, oh every time you speak, see
No doubt, got everything I need

I'll never go back, no, no, no
I'll never go, I'll never go back
I'll never go back, no, no, no
I'll never go, I'll never go back

[Verse 1]
It's not my baby, not the girl I knew then
Not the girl I know now, anymore
I wanna leave you, ""Baby don't you leave me
Baby don't you love me? Mi amor""

[Chorus]
Always look around girl, try to see the good things
Why you always say that you've never done wrong?
""Why you never hold me? Tell me that you love me
Why you always say that you'd never let go?""

I'll never go back

Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

[Pre-Chrous]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah

[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position

Letting go of your heart
Even though I tried
True days in your eyes
They don't ever lie
Hope I make it back in time

Oh, I can't deny
True days in your eyes
They don't ever lie
Hope I make it back in time

I wanna turn back time and
Go back to the days
When there was no doubt in my mind
Baby do you believe me

Letting go of your heart
I wanna push rewind and
Go back to the days
When you were the best that I had
Baby do you believe me
Never said it'd be easy

All day sleep 'n all night fun
Can I get a coffin
On Amazon?
Get my teeth done
With a diamond?

You know I like the taste of you
The way you shakey-shake-shake that body good

And no way to be sure

いつも曖昧すぎる態度で　傷ついてしまう
「どうして？」なんて聞けなくて
So it goes round and round
「恋じゃないんなら　冷たくして」
伝わることのない　想いだけを数える

こんなに切なくなって　こんなに心奪って
You're the only one I need

Ain't nobody　言葉よりもっと
Get me bodied　はっきりと知りたいの
Show me your love Show me now　ちゃんと
想いを伝えてよ Nobody
Can love you like I do
Like I do

壊してしまうことを怖がって　臆病になる
踏み出せないこの境界線
I walk around and around
いつまでこんなの続くんだろう
出口さえもない　叫びがまた落ちるよ

どんなに近づいたって　こんなに届かなくて
You're the only one I need

Sleeping in the Motel Six
We take all of the backstreets home
Making sure your friends don't know

Still think about the very first kiss
But I could never lie to you

Maybe that is why we don't see the end

Skipping all the milestones
Just feeling good for now
As far as feelings go

I don't show that side, it's better for now

I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me

You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked 'em up
You know that they're my favorite

Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it

I ask myself a million questions in the dark
I lay in silence, but silence talks
It tells me heaven is no closer than it was

You take the sane in me and tear it like a page

It will beat, it will burn, burn, burn your love into the ground

'Til you get lonely, sure I get lonely, sometimes
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe
I hate the bar
Pharmacy addict hit a Wall Street traffic, took the car
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it, skrrr
Crash on the floor, catch the ZZZ's
Poppin' the polar opposite, the NZT
Hip hop and the propaganda say they name brand
But I done seen how the - did my main man
The nights we won't remember
Are the nights we won't remember
I'll be gone 'til November
All my city calls me Simba
Dreams are made for cages nigga
Lions are for real nigga
Dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills nigga
Friday's are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest in peace the recipe
The rest of us are praying that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe
Don't even know me
Sure I get lonely some nights
When the angels on my shoulder
Slump my head
I'm stuck here with the vultures
Hissing and circling
You didn't call me, call me, call me, call me
I'm crawling, crawling, crawling back to you

'Cause what if I couldn't get back up?
Tell myself I'm better off alone
'Cause knowing me, I'd always run

Give in to desire
I'm not gonna fight it
No,I won't deny that

Ready for love
It's nothing to rush

The way you played it was unreal
That's how I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you hold me?
Make me feel like I'm the only one that matters
Make me matter
Be romantic
Can you treat me like you used to do?

[Chorus]
No, we don't ever talk the same way
'Cause we got complicated
Now you just keep me waiting (Oh, no)
No, we don't ever talk the same way
Don't like this situation
You played me for attention (Oh, no)
No, we don't ever talk the same way

[Verse 2]
I'm writing songs about you
The only way to clear my head
And get out of bed (And get out of bed, no)
Still with your watch you gave me
To be reminded all before
When we were more

Another sunset
Another coast
Always in motion
Always so close
We chase illusions and the unknown
Straight through every time zone
They say we're running wild
That we do what we fear
Just like renegades
Or rebel pioneers
Spending days and spending nights
Looking for those highlights
Been lost in our
Picture perfect story
Caught up in this
Life without a worry
When moments fade and we're no longer young and free
We'll have this photograph
So capture this
Bittersweet emotion
For when we wish
Time moved in slow motion
When we grow old and reminisce about our past
We'll have this photograph
Forever running
Forever gone
Forget tomorrow
Forget it all
We dream in colors others can't see
Living wild and carefree
They say our aim is off
That we don't have a clue
Like hungry hearts
In need of things to do
We keep on driving in the dark
Searching for the right spark
Been lost in our
Picture perfect story (perfect story)
Caught up in this
Life without a worry (without a worry)
When moments fade and we're no longer young and free (young and free)
We'll have this photograph

Tired of misreading the signs

To the night, that our light is not around

Legends in our time
We're carving our initials in this world
More than acting like, we own it
Both the fall and climb
Beneath a generation's flag unfurled
For as long as we're the young, we're
Gonna hang out on a ledge
Unafraid of heights, or even letting go
For as long as we're the young, we're
Gonna take it to the edge
Unafraid to die, but scared of growing old
We don't need a guarantee
Meant to reassure
Uncertainty is always at our door
The price we pay for being free
Is never knowing when
What's ahead, to be tread will reach the end

My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby, ""The

Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, Hydroxycut

(Fire, Godzilla, fire) monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka

'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point, like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire, and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do, when you hand someone flyers
What goes around, comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack
Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink
Bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake!)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretendin' to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her, if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera
'Cause my lyrics never sit well, so they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry
Carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearin' up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (monster)
Trigger-happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em, I'm dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliteratin' everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me, out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon
Who went in me, and be on the receiving of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl
I got a trailer full of money, and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a-, man, stop

Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back
Memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever
And everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December
When somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you
But I know I will one day
Hey

Everybody hurts sometimes, everybody hurts someday
Eh eh
Everything will be alright, go on raise a glass and say
Eh

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through

'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories

Doo do do doo

Memories bring back
Memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt that all the hatred was too powerful to stop
Now my heart feel like an ember
And its lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya
That you know I'll never drop
Yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes, everybody hurts someday
Eh eh
Everything will be alright, go on raise a glass and say

Más que la carroña que se come los buitres

Y una gaditana que me tira por WhatsApp
Y me ensucia el carrete con fotitos que achicharran

Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?

Non capito l'italiani, ma italiani de la zona
Il bambino Don Patricio e Cruzzi Cafunotti
De la piazza de la Caleta para el mundo entero
Pizza prosciutto, pizza tropicale, pan con ajo
Dos cincuenta, Coca-Cola grande
Espero que disfruten del disco de Patri
Vente, vacila un poquito
Que aunque yo me haga el loquito
Me encanta' y lo sabe'

Y no lo que ellos saben, eh

Ahora, vente donde tú ya sabe'
La verdad que conocerte no entraba en mis planes (Ay, ay, ay) No
Mira, aquel día se armó un fuerte pitote
To's en la Caleta, ¿bota'os, no?, suponte
Todos resacosos, que esa noche fue de lote
Y pa' recuperar pal' charco con el sol en el cogote
Estábamos con Kuko y con el Viti, tranquilotes
Y de pronto, de la nada, apareció un fuerte perote
Que entra, por ahí, tirándonos beso'
Me giro pal' nota y digo: ""Patri, ¿y eso?""
Te lo juro, no se cómo explicarlo
Era de fuera, de La Restinga o algo
Era preciosa y quedona, vio que la mirábamos
Que se tiró de piloto adrede pa' salpicarnos (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Y cuando salió del agua (Ay, papá)
Todos super cantosos en plan (Ay, papá)
Nos acercamos a hablar, en plan, a ver qué surge
Y nos suelta: ""No, sobran, si yo vine con Uge""

Me encanta' y lo sabe'
Y si está loca, loquita mía
Yo sé quién eres realmente

Don Patricio, mami, báilame el vena'o
Juega con los tazos y el bollica'o
Yo la pienso mucho, ella me tiene loquito
Pero dile a esa jevita que no estoy casa'o
Tu ropa en mi cuarto desordena'o
Deja ya a ese guacho, guatón, culiea'o
Hace ya un verano que no te damos verano
Pero el día del concierto está sold out
Papas arrugadas, mojito, pesca'o
Hazte una fontana, chiquito tumba'o
Yo vine a buscarte pero, mami, ¿qué tienes?
Ay, si te lo pongo dedica'o
Pura crema, arroz con habichuela'
Déjate de especias, mami, vamo al grano
Y dile que bailando te conocí
Y que nos la gozamos
Pa' dentro, carajo
Tengo buena espina
Comiéndome un gajo
Pura vitamina
No encuentro trabajo
No quiero otra vida
Poquito pa' abajo

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna
Beer-bust like I had last week
I must stay deep because talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue, you know they getting sweeter (uh)
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me is flirting is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (ah)
Mambo Number Five (ah)
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hand on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hand once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this then you're doing it right
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am

Pieces of valentine
With just a song of mine
To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold

In the sweetest dream
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all my life
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh, oh
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart
All alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms

Come on dream on, boy, your dream will come alive
Come on dream on, come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy, your dream will come alive
Once again a song comin' strong,
Here to remind you got to dream on.
Go for what you know don't let it slide,
Take a change let's ride.
To the future not to the past,
Take it easy and not too fast.
Many failed in society,
To blind to see you need to be free.
Free from the strain that causes pain,
Pain is the name and life is the game.
Dream on try to survive,
Keep hope alive reach for the sky.
Do the best you can make a wish come true,
Listen here's the clue: Let it flow before it's all gone
Come on boy you got to dream on.
Try to relax and move to the track,
Go for your goals and don't hold it back.
Strive to keep you dreams and hopes alive,
Do it now and don't pass it by.
Life is to short so give me your hand
I will lead you to another land.
D. R. O. C. K. Is here with the light,
Shinin' bright cause I'm right.
Close your eyes and just concentrate,
It's never to late to erase the hate.
Focus your mind when I say my rhymes,
Cause I'm always on time.
Do the best you can make a wish come true,
Listen here's the clue: Let it flow before it's all gone
Come on boy you got to dream on
Dreams are the way to express yourself from the heart
Now it's time to depart. On a journey for the mind
Peace of mind is what you will find.
Like Martin Luther King,
I had a dream, that we all would sing
In peace and harmony comin' strong.
Come on boy you got to dream on"

Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain

Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates, heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope

[Bridge 1]
Oh, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh, take it easy now
Uh, alright

[Chorus 2]
Let's talk about sex, baby (Sing it)
Let's talk about you and me (Sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex (Come on)
Let's talk about sex (Do it)
Let's talk about sex (Uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex

[Bridge 2]
Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right
Yo, Pep, I don't think they're gonna play this on the radio
(And why not? Everybody has sex)
I mean, everybody should be makin' love
(Come on, how many guys you know make love?)

[Chorus 1]
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

[Verse 3]
What we have here is subject to controversy
A three-letter word some regard as a curse, see
He may fiend and have a wet dream
Because he seen a teen in tight jeans
What makes him react like that is biological
But scheme of gettin' in those jeans, is diabolical
But of course he does it, and she gives him rap
And before you even know it, they jump in the sack
As a matter of fact, sometimes it’s like that
But anyway, ready or not, here he cums
And like a dumb son-of-a-gun, oops, he forgot the condoms
“Oh well,” you say, “what the hell, it’s chill
I won’t get got, I’m on the pill""
Until the sores start to puff and spore
He gave it to you, and now it’s yours

[Chorus 1]
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby

And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex

Let's kick it
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with a brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance
Go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gangway
You better hit bull's eye
The kid don't play
And if there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning 'em if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say, ""Hi""
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I bust a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead
Yo, so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
My style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""Damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic when I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla ice

Between voice and drum

Rhythm is a dancer

[Verse: Turbo B]
Let the rhythm ride you, guide you, sneak inside you, set your mind to
Move to its pulsation, bass vibration, synth sensation
Pause, it's not in place, see, mind and body must be free to
Please, take it all in, nothing to lose, everything to win
Let it control you, hold you, mold you, not the old, the new
Touch it, taste it, free your soul and let it baste you
Got to be what you wanna
If the groove don't get you, the rifle's gonna
I'm serious as cancer when I say rhythm is a dancer

[Chorus: Thea Austin]
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

[Post-Chorus: Thea Austin]
Oh, it's a passion
Oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh, it's a passion
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Thea Austin]
Rhythm
You can feel it, people feel it

Tell me did the darkness cry mercy
As You rolled back that rock?

Wonderin' if you knew about Him
And let Him inside for eternal life
Last night woke up in a cold sweat
With the same nightmare that I had an old friend
Guess I should've told him that you never know when God is gonna blow in

Though I walk through the valley
Or a sea full of sorrows
There's hope all around me
There's light in the shadows
With the face of a lion
And the warmth of a father
Fire beside me
There's coal burning brighter

[Chorus]
I can't explain this feeling
Deep inside, it fills my life
Your love will light the way
Your love will light my way
I can't explain this feeling
Deep inside, it fills my life
Your love will light the way
Your love will light my way

[Verse 2]
In the middle of a dry land
When I feel like I'm driving
There's a hand that is reaching
There's a voice that is calling
With words like a river
And a mouth full of power
You speak to the mountain
They tremble and cower

I'm always holding my own
Everytime I turn around
There's something

People talking about what they don't know
And when I try to move on up
They always pulling me down

I'm tired and I've had enough
It's my life
And I'm living it now

And crying next to you wonder
If we'll ever be the same
But all these tears will be a remind
For when i fall in love again
Now he is intrigued (if i fall in love again)
I'll be myself (if i fall in love again)
I know that in the end you're gonna be the one
If i fall in love again

How do we bear anymore

Salvation is an open door
We dreaded, we dreaded
Sometimes we're even ammused

Flattered to look around and see
Such a dime passing looks at me
Sweety like candy
And shorty got a mighty body

Just like it was on T.V
Missy bumped into me
Yeah she’s got a plan, she’s tryna work it out
Not even if she hadda keep trying till 5

She’s beauty
with lots of goodies
I like the way
She’s movin me
And while the club is hype
We can get out of sight
Run it to the rhythm
Baby dance it all out

Chorus:
What’s it gonna be
If I don’t grab you now
And show you how
A little fella does it
What’s it gonna be
If I keep hangin
And let you pass me by
What’s it gonna be
If I don’t make my move
And pull you through
This evening
The way you flirt and smile
With grace and style (Ouh)
Baby all you gotta do is
Try me (Give it a go)

Now we’re hangin’ out together
Could we hook up later?
This night gotta last a bit longer
Are you and me
Really meant to be?

She’s beauty
with lots of goodies
I like the way
She’s movin’ me
So catlike
When she plays me
Keep it going
Keep it going baby
Don’t stop

Chorus

(Let’s go) Ouh, la la la la la la la la la

You use what you got
Just to get what you want
While ya drill drill
Drill my mind
Shake it to the west
Let me do all the rest
Cause baby you’re dealing
With the best of the best

Na na na na na na na (x4)

No I won't leave you behind
I′m not gonna hide it from you
I'm not gonna fight it if it's true
I′m not gonna find it without you
Right here by my side
No I won′t leave you behind
I trust you when it matters
No lie is worth the pressure
Rather be honest then deceive each other
And trust that we will find
Our hearts in neon lights
Shadows hiding in the dark
When I dream of you
Always on my mind
Cuz what we've been through
Running all our lives
Trusting you with all of mine
Right here by my side
No I won′t leave you behind
I'm not gonna hide it from you
I′m not gonna fight it if it's true
I′m not gonna find it without you
Right here by my side
No I won't leave you behind
Always hiding in the dark
Always hiding in the dark
Hidding in the dark
Shadows hiding in the dark
When I dream of you
Always on my mind
Cuz what we've been through
Running all our lives
Trusting you with all of mine
Right here by my side"

Turnin' off my phone just to get out of bed
Get home every evenin' and history's repeatin'
Turnin' off my phone 'cause it's hurtin' my chest
Hey

And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah
But what can I do?
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

All I hear is voices, everybody's talkin'
Nothin' real is happenin' 'cause nothing is new
Now, when all this tragic, and I just feel sedated
Why do I feel numb? Is that all I can do? Yeah

And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah (Uh)
But I'm only human
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe (Though I do believe)
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

And Heaven knows I'm not helpless
But what can I do? Yeah
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
I try to do the things I say that I believe (I do believe)
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach"
